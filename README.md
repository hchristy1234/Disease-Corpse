# Installing the Game

## Download ZIP
You can download the ZIP file by going to the green "code" button and then clicking "Download ZIP"<br>
Unzip the file after downloading

## Run the code
Run `main.java` and the game should automatically begin.<br>
If you are doing this through command line, first `cd` into the folder you downloaded the game in. Then, type `javac main.java` to compile, and `java main` to run.<br>
If the code isn't working, make sure the assets folder and `Image.java` are in the same file path
